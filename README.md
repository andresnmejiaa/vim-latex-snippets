# vim-latex-dotfiles
These are my dotfiles that I use for Vim + LaTeX, as well as some of the snippet shortcuts I use.

I am using [MacVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim) together with [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/) as a PDF viewer. I have borrowed much of my .vimrc file from [https://github.com/dicai/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc](https://github.com/dicai/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc).

Snippets are written using [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips).

I am always looking for ways to optimize my workflow, so I welcome pull requests with suggestions for LaTeX snippets.
